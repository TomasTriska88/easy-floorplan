/**
 * Collapses a burst of values into one delivery per animation frame.
 *
 * Pointer events arrive faster than a browser can render — a 1000Hz mouse
 * against a 60Hz display is 16 events per frame. Handling every one of them
 * does not make the drag smoother, it makes it *later*: the work queues up and
 * the gap between the cursor and what it is dragging grows for as long as the
 * gesture lasts. Delivering only the newest value each frame bounds that queue
 * at one event, so the drag can fall at most one frame behind however fast the
 * pointer moves.
 *
 * The scheduler is injected so tests can drive frames by hand.
